This repository contains a simple SQL query that demonstrates a common error in comparison operators.  The original query uses the `>` operator to filter employees based on salary but excludes those earning exactly 100000.  The solution demonstrates the correct approach using the `>=` operator. This example highlights the importance of precise operator selection when performing data filtering in SQL.
